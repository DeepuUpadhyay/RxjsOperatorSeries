## 🔧 Operators Covered



### ✅ Fully Enhanced Operators:- 📚 **Comprehensive definitions** explaining what the operator doesRun `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

- **🔗 MergeMap**: Flattening observables with parallel execution

- **🔄 SwitchMap**: Latest value switching with cancellation- 🌟 **Real-life examples** with practical use cases

- **📏 Take**: Limiting emissions and performance optimization  

- **➡️ ConcatMap**: Sequential processing maintaining order- 🎮 **Interactive demonstrations** showing operators in action## Running end-to-end tests

## 🛠️ Installation

## 🎮 Usage

### Prerequisites

### Navigation- Node.js (v16 or higher)

- Use the main dashboard to navigate between different RxJS operators- npm or yarn

- Each operator has its own dedicated page with comprehensive examples- Angular CLI (v16+)



### Interactive Demos### Setup Steps

- Click demo buttons to see operators in action

- Check browser console for detailed logging1. **Clone the repository**

- Real API calls demonstrate actual HTTP request handling   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rxjs-series.git

### Learning Path   cd rxjs-series

1. Start with basic operators (Take, Map, Filter)   ```

2. Progress to transformation operators (MergeMap, SwitchMap, ConcatMap)

3. Learn utility operators (Merge, DebounceTime, Retry)2. **Install dependencies**

4. Practice with real API integrations   ```bash

   npm install

## Development### Real API Integration

The merge operator demo makes actual HTTP requests to:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.- `GET /users?_limit=3` - User data

- `GET /posts?_limit=2` - Post data  

### Development server- `GET /comments?_limit=2` - Comment data

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

All requests run in parallel using the merge operator!

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.### Interactive Features

- **Search Debouncing**: Type in search boxes to see debouncing in action

### Running unit tests- **Button Click Handling**: Rapid click demos with proper debouncing

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).- **Error Simulation**: Retry mechanisms with real network calls

- **Performance Monitoring**: Visual feedback for optimization techniques

### Running end-to-end tests
